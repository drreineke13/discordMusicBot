# discordMusicBot

Discord music bot I am writing for my discord server.
Uses the yt-dlp application and ffmpeg to download the 
videos locally and converts them to opus encoded files.
From there, the discord++ library is used to handle most
of the discord interactions and the audio connections and
playing capibilities.
discord ++: https://github.com/DiscordPP
yt-dlp: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp
ffmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org/
An install of all of the above is required to compile the
bot, as well as changing the bot token to the user's bot.
